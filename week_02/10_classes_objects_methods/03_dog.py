Building on the dog exercise in the previous section:

1. Create a dog class and make the functions from the last class methods of the dog class.

2. Add an __init__() method that sets the following attributes:

    - name
    - color
    - age
    - is_hungry (should be a boolean)
    - percent_full

    Note: is_hungry should default to False, and percent_full should default to 100.

3. Change the sleep() method so that when the method is called, the attribute is_hungry is set to True
    and the attribute percent_full is decremented by 20 percent.

4. Change the eat() method so that when the method is called, the attribute is_hungry is set to False
    and the attribute percent full is incremented to 100.

5. Add a __str__() method to print out all the information about the dog.

6. Create at least two objects of the dog class to demonstrate the functionality.
