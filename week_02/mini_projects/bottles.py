-- GOAL --
Create a program that prints out every line to the song
"99 bottles of beer on the wall." This should be a pretty simple program,
so to make it a bit harder, here are some rules to follow.

-- RULES --
1) If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers,
    do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.
2) Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any
    numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
3) Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.
4) Put a blank line between each verse of the song.
