Using OOP with python to create a text based command-line interface role playing game. Digital dice included! ðŸŽ² ...


## Task

Build a text-based role playing game that has at least 2 classes:

* a `Hero()` class
* an `Opponent()` class

The Hero should encounter multiple Opponents of different strengths (or level) and be able to perform different actions in regards to them - at minimum **attack** and **run away**.

If the Hero chooses to **attack**, the program decides through a simulated dice throw that takes the current level into account, whether the Hero or the Opponent win this round.

Implement a result for either winning or losing, e.g. forcing the Hero to wait a few seconds before continuing in case they lose, or removing the Opponent from the Opponent pool in case the Hero wins.

## Hints

There is a finished possible solution available in [this repo](https://github.com/martin-martin/python-rpg), that allows you to safely defuse your digital rage against Paywalls, PHP and even Wordpress sites. ;)

However, I strongly suggest to build out your own example, because using what you are interested in makes for the most fun coding experiences and the biggest learning effect!

### How to

To inspect the pre-made solution [provided here](https://github.com/martin-martin/python-rpg), download the repo and run `main.py` in a Python 3 environment. The rest is [l]ookaround, [a]ttack, and [r]unaway.
