# extended RPG

Take a good look at your enemies 👁

They seem to have some things in common... But then again, also a set of
differences (some seem to be more evil than others!)

Employ the concept of [Inheritance](https://codingnomads.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PYO/pages/415531064/Inheritance) in order to further build out your RPG game.

## Tasks
- Create at least 3 sub-classes of your `Opponent` class, that has distinct
features or abilities
- Make sure that they are sub-classes (i.e. that they **inherit** from the super class),
thereby sharing the same attributes etc. as the general `Opponent` class
