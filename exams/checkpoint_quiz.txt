Please attempt these questions without the book and without using the
internet. Yes, you heard right! - this is the real thing!
Ah, and another thing... - only use Vim (or paper ;) for coding!

Remember that these questions are meant to be both a revisit as well
as a checkup for yourself to see which topics come easier and which
ones need some more focus. Take your time, and have fun! :)
Also: don't be too hard on yourself if there's something you don't know
yet. All of you are doing great, everyone learns differently and at a
Different speed. You're well on your way!
Take note of what comes difficultly, and come back to revisit it later.
Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint!

I also want you to remember far you've already come in only three weeks,
and that learning simply takes time and practice.
Ok that's all, now let's get to practicing!! :)
