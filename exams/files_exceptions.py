'''
You have a folder containing three text files of books from Project Gutenberg:
- war_and_peace.txt
- pride_and_prejudice.txt
- crime_and_punishment.txt

1) open war_and_peace.txt, read the whole file content and store it in a variable

2) open crime_and_punishment.txt and overwrite the whole content with an empty string

3) loop over all three files and print out the first 100 characters. the program
    should NEVER terminate with a Traceback.

    a) which Exception can you expect to encounter? why?

    b) how do you catch it to avoid the program from terminating with a Traceback?

4) EXTRA: write a custom Exception that inherits from Exception and raise it if the
    first 100 characters of any of the files contain the string "attention".
