Write a script that searches a folder (and all its subfolders) on your computer and compiles a list of all of
all .jpg files (with the complete path of the files).

If you are feeling bold, create a list for each kind of file extension you find in the folder.

Start with a small folder to make it easy to check if your program is working correctly. Then sub out the
folder name with a bigger folder. This program should work for any specified folder on your computer.
