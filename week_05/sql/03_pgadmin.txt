Using pgadmin:

- create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

- create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


- create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

- create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

- populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

- Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)

    - select all records from users
>>> SELECT * FROM users;

    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"
>>> SELECT * FROM cars WHERE make='Opel';

    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car
>>>
SELECT u.first_name, c.model FROM users as u
JOIN users_cars as uc
ON u.id = uc.user_id
JOIN cars as c
ON c.id = uc.car_id;

    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car
>>>
SELECT u.first_name, u.last_name FROM users as u
JOIN users_cars as uc
ON u.id = uc.user_id
JOIN cars as c
ON c.id = uc.car_id
WHERE c.color='Red';

    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table
>>>
INSERT INTO users (id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (7, 'Daniel', 'French');

INSERT INTO cars (id, make, model, color, year)
VALUES (6, 'Toyota', 'Aygo', 'Blue', 2010);

    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table
>>> UPDATE users SET last_name='Farco'  WHERE id=1;

    - delete one record from the database
>>> DELETE FROM users_cars WHERE id=5;
>>> DELETE FROM cars WHERE model='Vectra';
