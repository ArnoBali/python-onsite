'''
Following the same process and tools we used in class,
create an API that serves textual information.

What topic your API is about is your own choice,
however it needs to fulfill the following specs:
* ingest API data from at least 1 external source
* combine (and/or manipulate) the received data in a meaningful way
* store your altered data in a Postgres database
* serve the data at an endpoint (e.g. using sandman2)

TIP: consider using data from twitter or slack (but anything goes)!
