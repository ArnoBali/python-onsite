Using the tweepy package, build a script that separates twitter handles
into different groups according to the number of their followers.

The classes can be whatever you like (e.g. I used ASCII art birds ;)

CHALLENGE: Also fetch the number of their friends and display the ratio
between followers and friends in an interesting way.
