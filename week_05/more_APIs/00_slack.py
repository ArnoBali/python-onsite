Create a slack API token for the codingnomads workspace.

Using the slackclient package, fetch all comments that include links
from the python-resources channel.

Store the links in a JSON file that has the following form:
[
    {
        "link": "the fetched URL",
        "description": "short blurb describing the resource (if available)",
        "date_added": "when was it posted?",
        "read": False  # defaults to False, change to True if you read it
        "rating": 0  # on a scale from 1-10, initially 0
        "comments": [
            "a list of strings",
            "with comments on the resource",
        ]
        "starred": False,  # defaults to False, change to True if you think it's great
    },
    # next link item
]

We will continue to work with this data throughout the week, so make sure to complete it!
