Using tweepy, create a script that programmatically tweets to your twitter account.

Create a JSON file that includes a number of tweets you want to post.
Your script should read from that JSON file, select some text and tweet it
whenever you run the script.

BONUS: Look into CRON jobs to automate your tweets to go out at scheduled times.
       E.g.: "Don't start without me, I'm nearly there!" every weekday at 9:14... ;P
