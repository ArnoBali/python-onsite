'''
Using the PokéAPI https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html#pokemon
fetch the name and height of all 151 Pokémon of the main series.

Create a text document that describes each Pokémon using the information
available in the JSON response.
NOTE: only using 'height' is enough, but if you want more, go crazy.

BONUS: Using your script, create a folder and download the main 'front_default'
       sprites for each Pokémon using requests into that folder.
       Name the files appropriately using the name data from your response.
