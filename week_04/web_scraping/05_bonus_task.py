Explore whether you can use the JavaScript support with requests_html,
to scrape the youtube comments from a video page you are interested in.
( you can use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M54UFvJqQ5I )

Parse the content, locate the usernames of the people who commented,
and save all comments to file in the following form:

username:
    comment text

username:
    comment text

etc.

If requests_html doesn't quite make it and you want to learn more
about scraping dynamic page content, check out 'selenium'.
